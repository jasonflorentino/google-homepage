# Google Homepage
*A recreation of the Google homepage to practice HTML and CSS*

**As part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), I built a replica of the Google homepage from scratch. In doing so I got nice and comfy styling and positioning with CSS, and hacked my own way at doing some of the various hover effects in the real thing. Don't bother actually clicking the links though! ;)**
